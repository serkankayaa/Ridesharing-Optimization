# Ridesharing-Optimization
Project that using Google Maps API, C# ASP.NET is solution for Manhattan traffic problem

Ride Sharing transforms urban mobility by providing timely and convenient access to anytime, anywhere, everyone. These services provide positive social impacts, pollution, energy consumption, bottlenecks, and so on. It presents a significant potential transformation in adverse situations.
While current mathematical models are new to the concept of travel sharing, it is seen that with a large-scale study, some benefits of the vehicle pool have been positively impacting the traffic problem.
Built for real-time high-capacity driving sharing, pre-existing models can be scaled for large numbers of passengers and travel, generating dynamically optimal paths with respect to online demand and vehicle locations.

The algorithm starts out greedy and improves with limited optimization, and quickly brings a good solution. Over time, comparisons are made with various methods for optimum assignment. For the first time, the relationship between the actual fleet size, capacity, dwell time, travel delay and total costs for low to moderate capacity has been discussed experimentally. The algorithm is approved with about 1 million coordinates. It is based on the data set in the Manhattan district of New York state. The experimental study takes into account the essential links between rider capacity and vehicle sharing. This algorithm applies only to taxi-derived vehicles. Intuitive methods should be used to optimize and run high-capacity tools with this algorithm. At this point, one of the biggest problems of today's world will be taken in order to pass the traffic problem in a big way.
